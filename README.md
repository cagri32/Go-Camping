# Go-Camping
Find an available spot quickly at the busiest camping grounds

I was planning to go to Banff National Park this summer for 10 days.
I knew that Banff was the busiest and fastest-booked camping ground in Canada.
I still tried checking the website a few times every day to find a consequtive 10-day spot to stay.
I was changing location and day filters to find a spot and repeating myself frequently.
Then I thought that I could do this faster and easier if there was a tool for that.

Therefore, I decided to write this script which would enter all the input and do all the selections I manually did.
After playing with it a little longer, I added more feature and expanded its functionality.
So far, it uses default values which are the days I want to stay there.
It can also take optional inputs such as day, month and number of nights to stay.

My short-term plans for this script are:
- to automate it to run in regular intervals
- to check a larger range of days to find the desired consequtively available spot
- to make it send me notifications if there is an availability

My long-term plans are:
- store the found the data on a database to operate faster and avoid scraping the website
- to have it calculate the average cost for the planned booking
- and finally turn it into a website using React JS so that others can benefit from it.

My efforts are already paid off for. As of today, I found the spot I am looking for.
Now I will continue to look for a better spot at Two Jack Lakeside Site and continue developing this program.
